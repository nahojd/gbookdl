Utility for downloading things from a book site

This is a download utility for downloading books (or rather, magazines) from Google Books. 
All you need is to provide the id of the book, it then downloads all the images from 
that book into a subfolder. These can then be zipped and used as a cbz file for offline 
reading.

This is of course strongly discouraged by Google, and may well get your IP blocked from Google Books,
so please don't use, or at least use it with care.
